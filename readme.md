## Introduction

An Interface for running simple sql queries without a SQL IDE

## Requirements


* Python 3.10+
* json
* tkinter
* sys
* psycopg2
* os
* datetime

## Optional Requirements
* pyinstaller
  

## __Instructions:__

### Setup:

Simplified installation and usage instructions can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nGEkgKNdkKOrfOSI5eol9Vj2pLpjtTXabGmMVlcCztw/edit?usp=sharing

* Create json config file in the following format:
>{\
    "dbname": " ",\
    "user": " ",\
    "host": " ",\
    "password": " ",\
    "query_filepath" : " ",\
    "output_filepath" : " ",\
    "generate_log": [Boolean],\
    "log_file_output_filepath": " "\
}

* **query_filepath,**  **output_filepath,** and **log_file_output_filepath** will be created based on config information in runtime if they do not exist.

* Place any .sql files you wish to run in your **query_filepath** directory.   
  
* If you need to generate an updated excecutable you only need Python 3.10+ installed. Run **generate_excecutable.bat**. After running, **LDliteSingleSelect.exe** will be up to date. This updates the executable from **LDliteSingleSelect.py** <u>**NOT**</u> from GitHub

### Usage:

* Run the program either by launching **LDliteSingleSelect.exe**, running **LDliteSingleSelect.bat**, or by running **LDliteSingleSelect.py** through the command line.
  
* Using the dropdown select the **Query Name** for the .sql file you wish to excecute.
  
* If desired modify the **Output File Name**.

* Enter values for any parameters the query requires. 
  
* Select **Run Query**
  
* When finished use **File>Exit** to close the program
  
## Notes
* It is recommended that you use PyInstaller to generate an executable version of LDliteSingleSelect.py to run instead 
of running it through LDliteSingleSelect.bat

* See https://github.com/5-C-Folio/LDlite-Queries for a collection of pre-created .sql files
* To create parameters to populate as options in the menu place any prompt text within curly brackets in the value of the desired parameter like so:
`'{Start Date (YYYY-MM-DD)}':: VARCHAR AS start_date`
